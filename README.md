# PersonalBudgetManager
User manual : This program allows user to enter their income, assuming it will be a fixed amount. The program will store expenses by category for each month of the year, so the maximum number of entries would be 12. The user can enter upto two new categories, which they would have to do at the very start of the program. There already are three pre-existing categories, namely "groceries", "shopping" and "travelling". The comparisons between spendings will be between different months of the year. The user will set a ideal budget amount once, and all comparisons and calculations will be done accordingly.
